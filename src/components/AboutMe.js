                        <p >Iâ€™m a software engineer passionate about connecting humanity through empathy and technology; everyone has a different story to tell, and I want to provide that service to people through my coding. I strive to create organized and meaningful code through stubborn determination and creativity. With a background in Humanities and civil service, I provide critical thinking to projects and strive for team connection and communication to get the job done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy working with collaborative teams to develop meaningful and fun applications for people to use. While I am a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is utilizing a PERN stack (API services, user-friendly React front-end). Hard engineering problems are always a fun challenge to tackle on my own, but I really enjoy and thrive working with a team that strives for communication and meaningful applications to benefit society as a whole. I'm looking for a full-stack engineering role where I can take on team collaboration, and gain experience with team leadership and project management.
